## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
```
The proposed solution is an AI-powered Smart Crop Advisory System that delivers personalized, real-time support to farmers through a mobile application and chatbot interface. It addresses the challenges of low literacy, language barriers, and lack of scientific advisory by combining AI, IoT, and data analytics.

Key Features:

Soil and crop health analysis using AI models.

Fertilizer and pesticide recommendation based on soil reports and pest images.

Multilingual voice-enabled chatbot for farmers with limited literacy.

Integration with weather APIs for real-time and predictive advisory.

Market price integration to guide farmers in selling produce profitably.

Offline mode for areas with poor internet connectivity.

Innovation and Uniqueness:

Localized, farmer-friendly advisory in native languages.

Voice-enabled support for inclusivity.

Combines soil, weather, pest, and market insights into one platform.

Continuous learning model that improves recommendations over time.•
```
## Technical Approach
```
Technologies Used:

Programming: Python, Java/Kotlin (Android app)

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch for image recognition & predictions

Backend: Node.js / Django, integrated with cloud services (AWS/Azure/GCP)

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

APIs: Weather APIs, Government agricultural data APIs

IoT integration (optional): Soil sensors

Implementation Process:

Collect soil, weather, and crop data.

Train AI models for fertilizer/pesticide recommendations and pest detection.

Build multilingual chatbot with text and voice support.

Integrate with real-time APIs for weather and market updates.

Deploy mobile application with offline-first capability.

```
## Feasibility and Viability
```
Feasibility:

Mobile-first approach ensures wide accessibility.

AI and cloud infrastructure are scalable.

Partnerships with government and NGOs can provide initial adoption.

Potential Challenges:

Limited internet access in rural areas.

Resistance to adopting technology by traditional farmers.

Data quality issues for localized farming conditions.

Mitigation Strategies:

Provide offline mode with SMS-based advisory.

Conduct farmer training workshops.

Use localized datasets and continuous model retraining.
